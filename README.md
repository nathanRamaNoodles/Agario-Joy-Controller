# AgarioJoyController(Invented by Nathan Ramanathan) 
![alt text][logo]

Used to play with Agar.io or other PC games that require the user's mouse to move a player around with the help of a joystick.
*Read complete directions at instructables.com (coming soon)*
But for those with experience with autohotkey and arduino, these directions below should be enough.
1. Run agario.ahk file through the [sciTe4Autohotkey](https://fincs.ahk4.net/scite4ahk/dl/s4ahk-install.exe) programmer.
2. hit the play button.
3. upload the arduino code to your arduino pro micro(5V version).
4. Wire the wii nunchuck to the arduino.
5. play (*may be necessary to change the center coordinates of the wii nunchuck in the arduino code*)
6.  GO to [agario's](https://www.agar.io) website for testing.  
7. go fullscreen and position your mouse exactly on the center of the player(or cell).
8.  Type the ULTRA COMBO "CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+S"
9.  And that's it. Go and play!  THe wii nunchuck's should map the computer's screen and move according to your movement of the joystick!
10. Oh yeah, to exit type "ESC"
11. To exit out of AUTOHOTKEY program, type "CTRL+ESC"

Extra feature!
1. Game Modes: While holding the nunchuck properly, make a stabbing movement up and then downward to change game modes.  Current two games modes are AGAR.io(default) mode and Slither.io mode. 
2. There is also a mouse mode. First hold the c button on the nunchuck and then perform the *Game Mode from (part a)*.     
3. Scroll Mode 1(In Mouse Mode only): tilt the wii nunchuck sideways to engage scroll mode.  In this mode, you move the joystick to scroll across pages.
4. Scroll Mode 2(In Mouse Mode only):tilt the other way and you can scroll even FASTER!
5. While in Mouse mode, shake nunchuck sideways to disable joystick.
6.While in either Game Mode, shake nunchuck sideways to exit out of a game(Similar to typing "ESC")
